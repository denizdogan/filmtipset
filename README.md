# filmtipset.el

This is a major mode for Emacs which I wrote in 2011.  It lets you use the website Filmtipset (http://nyheter24.se/filmtipset) via Emacs.  I haven't used it in a few years, because I've stopped using both Filmtipset and Emacs since I wrote it.

I'd be surprised if the API key still works.

To start Filmtipset:

    M-x filmtipset RET

To customize:

    M-x customize-group RET filmtipset RET
